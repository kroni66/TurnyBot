## Project Overview

This project includes a Streamlit-based web UI for interacting with a pre-trained Falcon model and a script for training the Falcon model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

### Components

1. **webui.py**: A Streamlit application that loads a pre-trained Falcon model, processes user input, and generates responses.
2. **falcontrainerV1.py**: A script for training a Falcon model using LoRA with a dataset loaded from a JSON file.
